# Bookclub

## What is Bookclub?

In this assignment, I needed to set up a niche community. A niche community such as an online platform where people with a specific interest come together. This can be, for example, a forum about a particular topic, a Facebook group, or a Discord server.

I've made a platform for book lovers. The platform is called Bookclub. On this platform, users can share their favorite books with written reviews. Users can comment on each other's reviews to let each other know what they think of the book. This all is done in a safe and friendly bookclub environment.
